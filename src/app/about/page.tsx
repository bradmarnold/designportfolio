            Hello! I'm Bradford Arnold, a volunteer at the University of Texas at Arlington FabLab 
            where I help students learn digital pattern drafting and sustainable garment construction.

            My goal is to empower students to use technology such as laser cutters and CAD software 
            to create high-quality garments while minimizing waste. With a background in fashion and 
            a passion for sustainability, I guide them through the entire processâ€”from drafting to 
            sewing, using quilted seams and other techniques.
          </p>

            Beyond teaching, I'm actively seeking sponsorships to provide materials like denim at 
            low or no cost. This initiative aims to increase retention and give every student the 
            opportunity to succeed.
