# Workshop Guide

This guide outlines the workflow we follow in our workshops.

## Digital Pattern Drafting

We start by drafting patterns in CAD software. Students learn to translate their ideas into precise vector shapes.

## Laser Cutting

Once the patterns are finalized, they are exported to the laser cutter. We nest multiple pieces into a single layout to minimize waste.

## Sewing & Assembly

After cutting, the pieces are sewn together using techniques like quilted seams and flat felled seams. We emphasise precision and sustainability throughout the process.
