# Upcoming Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm working on now and in the near future. They all reflect my interest in automation, sustainability, and hands‑on craftsmanship.

## Aquaponics sensors

I'm designing a set of low‑cost sensors to monitor pH, nutrient levels and temperature in small aquaponics systems. The goal is to automate data collection so that growers can keep their systems balanced without expensive equipment. Once the prototype is finished, I'll share the wiring diagrams, firmware and documentation.

## Cloud chamber improvements

The cloud chamber I built for particle physics demonstrations works well, but I'm experimenting with a new wooden frame for the cold plate to improve insulation. The aim is to prolong the viewing time without adding more coolant. I'll document the build process and share plans so others can replicate it.

## Kitchen tools: cutting board, spatula and vegetable knife

Following the success of my laser‑cut cutting board, I'm developing a line of kitchen tools. Using the university's plasma cutter and CNC equipment, I'm reproducing my favourite stamped Chinese vegetable knife and a De Bois style spatula from 14‑ and 12‑gauge steel. These tools will feature handcrafted maple or walnut handles to pair with the cutting board.

## Tutoring web app

As part of my tutoring work, I'm building a web application with a Khan Academy–style interface. It will offer randomized practice questions, track statistics and allow students to access practice tests via unique pages during one‑on‑one sessions. The goal is to make learning more efficient and tailored to each student's needs.

These projects illustrate how I apply the same ethos—combining heritage techniques with modern tools—to a range of disciplines. Stay tuned for updates as each one progresses.
