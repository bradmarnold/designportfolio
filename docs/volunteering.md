# Volunteering & Troubleshooting at the FabLab

I've been volunteering at the UTA FabLab to teach students how to digitally draft patterns, use a laser cutter to minimize fabric waste, and sew garments with professional techniques. This document captures some of the lessons and troubleshooting we've gone through.

## Laser cutting muslin & shirting

To cut muslin test garments, we experimented with different power settings on the Epilog Thunder laser. Power below 3% didn't cut, while 8% was too hot. We settled on 7% power at speed 10 for single-pass cuts with minimal charring. For full-size muslin layouts, we ran a second pass at 12% power to ensure complete separation. Using fabric weights helps keep the material flat during cutting, and leaving a half-inch buffer at the bottom of the bed ensures the pieces finish cleanly. Any pieces that didn't separate fully were trimmed with a rotary blade.

## Cutting denim

Denim requires a similar approach. We use a two-pass strategy: a first pass at around 7% power and a second pass at 12% to ensure complete separation without excessive burning. Adjustments to power and speed are made based on the thickness of the fabric. Accurate nesting of pattern pieces in Inkscape minimizes waste, and using the laser cutter eliminates the physical strain of cutting heavy denim by hand.

## Teaching & outreach

These volunteer sessions are about more than cutting fabric. Students learn digital pattern drafting in Valentina (Seamly2D), how to prepare files in Inkscape, and how to sew pieces together with techniques like felled and French seams. By providing free access to materials and equipment, we remove barriers for students who might not otherwise be able to explore garment design. The troubleshooting we do together—like dialing in laser parameters or rearranging pattern pieces to fit—is part of the learning process and helps build confidence.

Volunteering at the FabLab has been incredibly rewarding. It's an opportunity to share what I've learned about combining heritage techniques with modern tools, and to inspire others to explore sustainable garment-making.
