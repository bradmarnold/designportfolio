# Type 3 Jacket Research

The classic Type 3 trucker jacket is an icon of American denim. I’ve been studying vintage patterns and modern reinterpretations—from the 1967 Levi’s trucker to Raf Simons’ 2017 Calvin Klein collaboration—in order to draft my own version.

Using my shirt sloper as a starting point, I adapted the body and yoke to capture the distinctive pointed seams and chest pockets of the original Type 3. The patterns were drafted in Valentina and exported to Inkscape so I could nest the pieces efficiently for laser cutting. Test garments cut from muslin helped me dial in the fit before I move on to selvedge denim.

Ultimately, I plan to cut and sew a Type 3 jacket using Cone Denim, replacing the Andy Warhol “John Wayne” patch from the Raf Simons piece with my own embossed Randolph Scott patch. This project blends historical research with digital drafting and sustainable cutting techniques.
