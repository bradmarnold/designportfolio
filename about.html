      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! I’m Bradford Arnold, a volunteer at the University of Texas at
        Arlington FabLab where I help students learn digital pattern drafting and
        sustainable garment construction.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to empower students to use technology such as laser cutters
        and CAD software to create high‑quality garments while minimizing waste.
        With a background in fashion and a passion for sustainability, I guide
        them through the entire process—from drafting to sewing, using quilted
        seams and other techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond teaching, I’m actively seeking sponsorships to provide materials
        like denim at low or no cost. This initiative aims to increase
        retention and give every student the opportunity to succeed.
